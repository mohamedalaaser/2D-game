This is a simple 2D game implemented using opengl.

You can start the game by opening and running the file "OpenGL2DTemplate.sln" using visual studio.

Collect coins to increase in score, change lanes to avoid obstacles and stay alive as long as you can.

The game will get faster every time you collect 5 coins.

You can use the following controlls to play the game:

'a' : move left

'd' : move right
